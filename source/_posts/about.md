title: About Me
---

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shengli Zhou, a 3rd year undergraduate student majoring Computer Science and Technology at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn). I'm currently doing research at [VIP Lab](https://zhengfenglab.com/), supervised by [Prof. Feng Zheng](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhengfeng.html). My research interest mainly focuses on Multi-modal Perception and Embodied Intelligence.

## Selected Projects

{% notel blue Masked-Unmasked-Face-Recognition %}
A face recognition model based on step-wise exclusion, achieving relatively high accuracy without using deep learning. The method facilitates local features of the face with self-adaptive weights, which can handle face recognition tasks with partial occlusion well.
{% endnotel %}

{% notel red CARP-Solver %}
A Capacitated Arc Routing Problem solver based on Evolutionary Simulated Annealing, which can find solutions that are nearly as optimal as the solutions founded by MAENS.
Project repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/fz-zsl/CARP)
{% endnotel %}

{% notel green Reversed-Reversi %}
An Artificial Intelligence model for playing based on Genetic Algorithm, Minimax Search and Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Project repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/fz-zsl/Reversed-Reversi)
{% endnotel %}

{% notel purple Image-Steganography %}
An algorithm for performing image steganography based on Discrete Cosine Transform, Hamming Code and Least Significant Bit Steganography under prime radix.
Project repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/fz-zsl/Hide-Watermark)
{% endnotel %}

{% notel orange LibTensor %}
An implementation of LibTensor in C++, supporting high-dimensional python-style tensor operations with OpenMP and CUDA acceleration.
Project repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/fz-zsl/LibTensor)
{% endnotel %}
